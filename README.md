# IMAGE_DETECTION-MODEL-PROJECT


📌 YOLOv11 Image Object Detection using Streamlit

This project demonstrates real-time image object detection using the YOLOv11n deep learning model deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application. Users can upload images and instantly visualize detected objects with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

The application is lightweight, cloud-deployable, and optimized for Streamlit Cloud using Python 3.11.

🚀 Features

🔍 Object detection using YOLOv11n

🖼 Upload image (jpg, png, jpeg, webp)

📦 Bounding boxes with labels & confidence

⚡ Fast inference with Ultralytics YOLO

☁️ Deployable on Streamlit Cloud

🧠 Beginner-friendly AI project

🛠 Tech Stack
